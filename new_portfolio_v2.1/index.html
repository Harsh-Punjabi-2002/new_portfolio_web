                <p>Hi there! I am Harsh! I've been coding for over 4 years now. As a EEE student I've worked both with
                    managerial(ECE Society) and technical(Coding Ninja , CAB-EEZ) companies to help build &
                    scale their companies. Along the journey I realised my passion existed in extending help and guiding
                    others excel and pursue their dreams in technical fields. With this passion, I have now helped
                    hundred's of associates and subordinates around me, through online sessions on Google Meet, and also
                    interacting in person. I always look to give back to the community in whichever way possible.</p>
